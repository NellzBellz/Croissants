        A true French croissant is made with only butter, while those made with margarine or other fats must be labeled "croissant ordinaire" in France! 🥐

        The croissant, with its delicate, flaky layers and golden, buttery aroma, is more than just a pastry—it’s a masterpiece of culinary artistry. Though often associated with France, its origins trace back to Austria, where it was inspired by the kipferl, a crescent-shaped bread enjoyed as early as the 13th century. The modern croissant, perfected by French bakers in the 19th century, owes its airy texture to the labor-intensive laminating process, which involves folding butter into dough multiple times to create hundreds of paper-thin layers. A true croissant shatters delightfully with every bite, releasing an irresistible mix of crispiness and softness that pairs perfectly with everything from sweet jams to rich, velvety coffee. Whether enjoyed plain, filled with chocolate, or stuffed with almonds, this timeless pastry remains a universal symbol of indulgence and sophistication.
